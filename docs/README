MUGODISKSPACE EXTENSION
=======================

   The purpose of this extension is to place statistics about disk space directly on your eZ Publish
   dashboard (or in any template you want).
   
   We decided to develop this extension after a few cases where clients' eZ Publish installations were
   mysteriously behaving erratically, and the cause was that their servers had run out of space.
   Since that would probably not be the first thing you would expect when it happens, this dashboard widget
   is helpful to alert users before the unexpected happens!

INSTALLATION
============

1/ Extract the mugodiskspace folder to your extension folder.

2/ Enable the extension, clear the cache, and regenerate the autoloads array.

3/ Edit the extension/mugodiskspace/mugodiskspace.ini.append.php file, setting the "path[]" to the list of
   drives you want to monitor on your server. On a Windows server, the path can be "C:", "D:", etc while on a
   Unix server the path would be something like "/" or "/dev/sda1".

4/ That's it! Your dashboard should now display disk space information for each of the paths.

   You can also display disk space information in any template by calling the operator:

   {def $diskStats = getDiskSpace( $pathToDrive )} where $pathToDrive is the path of the drive you want to 
   monitor as described above. The variable $diskStats will then be an array with the following values:
   $diskStats.total: total disk space
   $diskStats.free:  disk space available
   $diskStats.used:  disk space used

IMPORTANT NOTES
===============

   If you already have dashboard.ini.append.php in the settings/override folder with a reset of the
   DashboardBlocks variable ( DashboardBlocks[] ) at the beginning of the DashboardSettings block, make
   sure you add the mugodiskspace block in that file as well: DashboardBlocks[]=mugodiskspace.

   This extension uses the disk_total_space() and disk_free_space() PHP functions, which require read
   permissions on the given path. If permissions are not properly set, the operator will return "N/A".
